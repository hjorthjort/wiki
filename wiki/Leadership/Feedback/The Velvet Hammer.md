From an [article](https://www.fastcompany.com/90319581/why-the-velvet-hammer-is-a-better-way-to-give-constructive-criticism) in Fast Company:

When someone's behavior is becomming a problem, don't give them feedback in the
"sandwich model", where you say something positive, then something negative,
and finally something positive. Instead, use the "velvet hammer" phrasing of
your feedback:

> Here’s the formula
> 
> Start with, “Got a minute? Great. I need your help.”
> 
> “It should be said in a way friendly,” says Baldridge. “Nothing about this is
> scary. And ‘I need your help’ is an international surrender of agenda. It’s a
> disarming way to get attention sincerely and genuinely. And you do need their
> help because their behavior is becoming problematic.”
> 
> Next, say, “I noticed that [problem behavior goes here.] (Pause) I was
> wondering what’s causing this problem (pause), because it cannot continue.
> What do you suggest we do?”
> 
> “The word ‘because’ is one of the 30 most persuasive words,” says Baldridge.
> “Everyone wants to know what comes after it.”
> 
> Also, asking what the person suggests we do is powerful because people are
> persuaded most by their own words, says Baldridge. The approach is designed
> to be nonthreatening, compassionate, and open-minded. It finds positivity in
> the way you communicate, mange, and lead, especially when you need to correct
> a problematic behavior.
